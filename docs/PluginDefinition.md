# Plugin Definition

Define custom plugins as separate packages

Modular Design: Ensure each plugin is self-contained and follows a modular design pattern. This will facilitate easier maintenance, updates, and scaling.

- Dependency Management: Use a robust dependency management system to handle plugin dependencies.
- Define a base structure, including abstract classes or interfaces that custom plugins must inherit from and implement their behaviors
- Core Interfaces and Abstract Classes: Define core interfaces and abstract classes that enforce a consistent structure and behavior across all plugins.
- Plugin Lifecycle Management: Define standard methods for initializing, starting, stopping, and destroying plugins to manage their lifecycle effectively.
- Error Handling: Incorporate error handling mechanisms within the base structure to ensure plugins can gracefully handle failures.

- Define and upload custom plugins to Fluent CMS and load them dynamically
- Plugin Registration: Provide a mechanism for registering plugins with the CMS, including metadata such as name, version, author, and dependencies.
- Dynamic Loading: Implement dynamic loading and unloading of plugins to allow for real-time updates and changes without requiring a system restart.
- Security: Implement security checks to verify the integrity and authenticity of plugins before loading them.

## Scenarios
- Examples of custom plugins: Payment Gateway Connector, Dynamic Navigation, Products Catalog, etc.
- Payment Gateway Connector: Integrate with various payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to facilitate online transactions.
- Dynamic  Nav: Allow dynamic generation and management of navigation menus based on user roles and permissions.
- Products Catalog: Provide a flexible catalog system for managing products, categories, and attributes.

## Proposal
- Each plugin has two major parts: frontend (UI features) and backend (serverside) functionalities
