## Submitting Changes

Once you've made your changes, push the branch to your fork on GitHub. Navigate to the main FluentCMS repository and create a new Pull Request. Ensure your PR title is descriptive, and include "Fixes #IssueNumber" if your PR closes a specific issue. In the PR description, provide a detailed overview of the changes. 
If applicable, include screenshots or GIFs showcasing the updates.

## Best Practices
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages, describing the changes in the commit.
- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to the coding standards used throughout the project.
- **Document Your Changes**: If your changes add or modify functionality, make sure to update or add corresponding documentation.
- **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionalities and, if possible, add tests to cover your new features.

## Reporting Issues
If you discover a problem or have a suggestion, please open a new issue. When describing your issue:

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce the issue, error messages, OS version, etc.
- If proposing a new feature, explain why you think it'd be beneficial, and how it fits into the existing project.

## Seeking Help
If you're unsure about anything — whether it's about the workflow, a piece of code, or even if a feature makes sense — please feel free to seek help in the issue section or directly contact the maintainers.
